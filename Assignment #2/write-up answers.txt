Write-up Questions


1. What considerations would have to be taken to add a columns class? 
   What would be the advantage?

	To add a column class, one must consider the rows of the array upon
	which the columns are built upon. The large advantage to having a 
	columns class would be easier access/finding a particular row
	knowing the column. 

2. What is forward declaration and how is it used? Why does it work?

	Forward declaration is declaring an identifier (function prototype, etc.)
	so that the compiler would know what to add when compiling main.cpp.
	The compiler wants to ensure the programmer hasn't made spelling mistakes
	or passed the wrong number of arguments to the function. Most of the 
	time, forwards declaration is used to significantly reduce 
	build times.

	Forward declaration works when the compiler encounters a call to a function;
	it’ll understand that the client is making a function call
	and can check to ensure the client is calling the function correctly
	even if it doesn’t know how or where the function is defined.


3a. What would the code look like to rotate a 2d array by 90 degrees? 


	int array[x][y];		// Size of the array (set x and y)
					// Assuming the array is of int values

	int n=4;			// Number size to move
	int temp;			// Temporary element to work with

	for (int i=0; i<n/2; i++){		// Loop through rows
        	for (int j=i; j<n-i-1; j++){	// Loop through columns

                	tmp=a[i][j];		// Get the temporary position of the array

              		a[i][j]=a[j][n-i-1];		// Copy the data around...
                	a[j][n-i-1]=a[n-i-1][n-j-1];
                	a[n-i-1][n-j-1]=a[n-j-1][i];

                	a[n-j-1][i]=tmp;		// Move it into temp and 
							// store it in the appropriate index 
     		   }
	}

   b. What would be the big-O notation for this operation?


	1	2	3
	4	5	6
	7	8	9  

	. . . 

	3	6	9
	2	5	8
	1	4	7


	The big-O for this proceedure would have to be at least O(n^2).
